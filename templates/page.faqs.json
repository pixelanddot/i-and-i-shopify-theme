However, gold is still a metal that requires proper care, for example, no harsh chemicals should come in contact with gold. Gold vermeil pieces can tarnish overtime if not cared for properly or simply due to environmental factors as it is plated on silver. However, with proper care, the life of gold vermeil jewellery can be prolonged significantly. Please refer to our Care page for further details on how to care for your jewellery.<\/p>",
