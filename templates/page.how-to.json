To ensure the longevity of the plating, we use at least 3-micron gold plating technique so with proper care, the jewellery should last you years. However, any jewellery that is not made in solid gold will likely tarnish over time. Therefore, care should be taken when wearing gold vermeil jewellery, such as avoiding harsh chemicals and direct contact with perfume and lotion. Moisture and heat is another factor that could cause tarnish, therefore storing gold vermeil jewellery in cool, dry places is advised. Despite higher maintenance, gold vermeil jewellery come at a more affordable price point than solid gold jewellery, making them a great choice for fashion jewellery.<\/p>",

The stones can be easily cleaned by warm soapy water. Certain gemstones such as emerald can be easily damaged by heat and are not as hardy as diamonds, therefore, special care must be taken when handling them, especially for bespoke pieces, where the gemstones tend to be larger.
