You are therefore advised to always remove all jewellery before using these products.<\/li><li>Try not to get gold vermeil jewellery wet as the coating come off more easily with water. Likewise hot weather, sunlight and the sea can be damaging. Chlorine can permanently discolour gold, silver and plated jewellery so you should avoid wearing it in pools and hot tubs.<\/li><li>It is also advisable to remove jewellery when exercising, cleaning, gardening or any other rough or physical work. Try not to wear it overnight to avoid tangling and scratching.<\/li><li>All jewellery should be stored separately to avoid scratching and rubbing against one another. A silk lined pouch like the one we supply is perfect for this. Stones, particularly emeralds, are very easily scratched. It is even possible to scratch a diamond with another diamond so take care when wearing and storing your diamond jewellery.<\/li><li>Do not store jewellery next to heating vents, windowsills or in the bathroom, as damp and hot conditions will cause the jewellery to tarnish.<\/li><li>To clean your jewellery rub the piece gently with a soft lint-free cloth or wash in warm soaping water in the case of solid gold. It is also recommended that you visit a jeweller once a year to have it cleaned professionally. This will keep them looking their best!<\/li><\/ul>",
